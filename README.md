# Animal Reconnect
Flutter project that incorporates backend (firebase)
Mobile application that allows users interact directly to the desired pet owner(s) in hopes to adopt their pet.

Features:
 - registration/login
 - email verification
 - matching/swiping system like tinder
 - user/pet profiles
 - one to one chat

Future plans:
 - implement more screens/details to make a robust process of the adoption (documents, medical history and such)
 - notification system
 - cleaner code for efficiency and better readability (converting to BLoC system)
